# SDG Translations

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/open-sdg/sdg-translations.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/open-sdg/sdg-translations)

A project to compile and translate text related to the United Nation's
  Sustainable Development Goals, and then provide those translations as JSON.

These translations are intended primarily for the open-source national reporting platform [Open SDG](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg), but can certainly be used for other NRPs or SDG-related projects.

More information [here](https://open-sdg.github.io/sdg-translations/).
